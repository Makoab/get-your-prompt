## ‚ú® Features

-   **Seamless Integration**: Activates via the right-click context menu on any selected text.
-   **Powerful Prompt Engineering**: Leverages the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to add context, specify format, and clarify intent.
-   **Simple Interface**: Displays the enhanced prompt in a clean, easy-to-read modal.
-   **One-Click Copy**: Instantly copy the generated prompt to your clipboard.
-   **Secure**: Your Google Gemini API key is stored securely in your browser's local storage and is never shared.
-   **Lightweight**: No unnecessary clutter or background processes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The extension takes your highlighted text and sends it to the Gemini API with a master prompt that instructs it to act as a prompt engineering expert. It reframes your basic idea into a detailed prompt that is more likely to yield high-quality results from an AI model.

**Original Text:**
> `explain how a black hole works`

**Enhanced Prompt (Example):**
> `Create a detailed yet easy-to-understand explanation of how a black hole is formed and its fundamental properties. Structure the explanation for an audience with a basic understanding of physics. Please cover the following key points:
> 1.  **Stellar Collapse:** How a massive star dies and leads to a singularity.
> 2.  **Event Horizon:** Define what the event horizon is and why nothing can escape from it.
> 3.  **Gravitational Pull:** Explain the concept of extreme gravity and its effect on spacetime.
> 4.  **Anatomy of a Black Hole:** Briefly describe the singularity and the accretion disk.
> 
> The desired output should be approximately 3-4 paragraphs long.`

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

Since this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, you will need to install it manually in developer mode.

### 1. Download the Code

2.  **Save the Key**:
    *   Click on the "AI Prompt Enhancer" icon in your browser's toolbar (you may need to "pin" it first).
    *   The settings popup will appear.
    *   Paste your API key into the input field and click **Save API Key**.
